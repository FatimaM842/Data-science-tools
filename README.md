# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook titled **DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb** for my final project. The notebook provides an overview of essential tools, languages, and libraries commonly used in Data Science. It includes:

- Ordered lists of popular Data Science languages and libraries
- A table summarizing key Data Science tools
- Example arithmetic expressions in Python
- Code to convert minutes to hours
- A summary of objectives
- Author attribution

## How to Use

1. Open the `DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Execute the code cells to see results for arithmetic operations and time conversion.
3. Review the markdown cells for lists, tables, and information about the Data Science ecosystem.
